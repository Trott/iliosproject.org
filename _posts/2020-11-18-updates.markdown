It's been some time since I've been able to update this log on the site, but rest assured we have been busy over at Ilios!

Since our last post, the pandemic has continued to sweep across all we do, and we have responded by providing Ilios with a more robust set of features to address the scheduling and management of online learning sessions; we've also revamped our offerings manager, improved calendar display and delivery, and of course launched our newly updated API version. And yes -- Ilios is now faster, and more responsive than ever.

Please [contact us](mailto:support@iliosproject.org), with any questions or interests.

__STATUS__:
- current version: __3.83.1__
- next scheduled release: __11/20/2020__
