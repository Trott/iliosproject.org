Summer is here, and work continues on checklists and reporting, as well as security and performance improvements. With the current release of __v3.88.0__ Ilios has moved on to require PHP 8, so please be sure that your servers are up to date prior to migrating to this or future versions of Ilios!

In short, we are here for you, and ready to face the future! And that future includes this year's upload cycle for the AAMC Curriculum Inventory: if you need assistance, please don't hesitate to let us know.


__CURRENT STATUS__:
- current version: __3.88.0__
- next scheduled release: __07/16/2021__
