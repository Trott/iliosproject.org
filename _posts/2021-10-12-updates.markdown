Welcome to pumpkin season here at Ilios! We have now released **v3.90.3**, which includes notable improvements for both instructor and learner views, as well as a bunch of under-the-hood code updates to make Ilios better. With 9 core releases since the beginning of June 2021 (and an additional 14 other UI and frontend releases), we have kept on a fairly aggressive release schedule for updates and enhancements despite the vagaries of pandemic times. We hope you and your users have appreciated the continued dedication of the Ilios team.

The AAMC Curriculum Inventory upload window is coming to a close, so if you participate, please remember to get your report into the portal prior to the 21st of October. There will be no extensions this year!

__CURRENT STATUS__:
- current version: __3.90.3__
- next scheduled release: __10/22/2021__
