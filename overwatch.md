<span style="font-family:cursive;font-size:2em; font-weight:bold;">S</span>ituated atop a small island rising from the Aegean Sea, Ilios is a postcard-perfect Mediterranean town, with a bustling harborside, winding paths for rambling hillside strolls,  gorgeous vistas, and a thriving community of medical educators. It is the ideal vacation stop for people looking for a place to relax, medical trainees looking to expand their knowledge, or for those interested in exploring the ruins scattered at the top of the island, where many artifacts and relics of the ancient world have been recently unearthed, along with a variety of remarkably sophisticated calendaring tools. The ruins were declared an internationally protected heritage site. Ilios also has the finest schools in the islands, with a managed curriculum mapped to competencies for success, contentment, and fulfillment. Wifi reception throughout the island is excellent, and all villages are wired with fiber optic cable for premium access to the global interwebs.
