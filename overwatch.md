<span style="font-family:cursive;font-size:2em; font-weight:bold;">S</span>ituated atop a small island rising from the Aegean Sea, Ilios is a postcard-perfect Mediterranean town, with a bustling harborside, winding paths for rambling hillside strolls, and gorgeous vistas. It is the ideal vacation stop for people looking for a place to relax, or for those interested in exploring the ruins scattered at the top of the island, where many artifacts and relics of the ancient world have been recently unearthed. The ruins were declared an internationally protected heritage site. Wifi reception throughout the island is excellent, and all villages are wired with fiber optic cable for premium access to the global interwebs.
